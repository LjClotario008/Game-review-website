    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\cod1.jpg">
    <p>Call of Duty: Mobile brings the iconic FPS franchise to mobile devices with impressive polish and performance. It offers a fast-paced and fluid shooter experience, staying true to the core CoD formula while adapting it perfectly for touch controls. Players can engage in various modes such as Team Deathmatch, Domination, Search & Destroy, and Free-for-All, all set across classic Call of Duty maps like Nuketown, Crash, and Firing Range. The game also features a fully-fledged Battle Royale mode with solo, duo, and squad options, combining large-scale survival gameplay with the tight gun mechanics CoD is known for.
        Controls are smooth and responsive, with options for both simple and advanced modes, giving players the choice between auto-fire and manual aim. Aiming, movement, and grenade usage feel intuitive on mobile, and the HUD can be customized to fit personal preferences. The game runs well on most devices, with scalable graphics settings that range from low to ultra, ensuring smooth performance even during intense firefights. For players who enjoy ranked competition, the Ranked Multiplayer and Ranked BR modes offer seasonal ladders with exclusive </p>

    <p class="game-rev">WEAPON AND LOADOUTS</p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\cod2.jpg" >
    <p>One of the strongest features of CoD: Mobile is its weapon customization system. Players unlock a wide variety of guns, including assault rifles, SMGs, snipers, shotguns, and pistols, each with its own unique feel and recoil pattern. The Gunsmith system allows deep customization with attachments like scopes, barrels, stocks, grips, and perks, enabling players to fine-tune weapons to match their playstyle. Scorestreaks like UAVs, Predator Missiles, and Sentry Guns also return, rewarding players for strong in-game performance. Loadouts can be fully customized with tactical and lethal grenades, operator skills, and perks, providing strategic flexibility in every match.

      <p class="game-rev">MAPS AND MODES</p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\cod3.jpg">
    <p> Mobile features a strong lineup of maps, many of which are remastered fan-favorites from the console versions of the franchise. From close-quarters chaos in Shipment to sniper duels on Crossfire, the game provides a diverse set of environments that cater to different playstyles. In addition to standard multiplayer maps, the Battle Royale map—Isolated—is expansive and filled with varied terrain, vehicles, airdrops, and boss zones. Regular mode rotations and limited-time game types (like Zombie mode, Snipers Only, and Prop Hunt) keep the experience fresh and engaging.

  <div class="game-entry">
    <p class="game-rev">EVENT</p>
  <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\cod4.jpg ">
  <p>Events are a major part of the Call of Duty: Mobile ecosystem. The game operates on a seasonal model, with new Battle Passes released monthly, offering free and premium tracks loaded with skins, weapon blueprints, operator outfits, and in-game currency. Each season also introduces new limited-time events, challenges, and sometimes game-changing content like new guns or operators. Collaborations and seasonal themes—such as Halloween, Lunar New Year, or futuristic military ops—add visual flair and fun objectives to complete. These events keep players engaged and give them goals to chase beyond regular progression.
