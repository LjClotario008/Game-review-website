  <h1>MOBILE LEGEND</h1>
  <div class="game game-entry">
    <p class="game-rev">GAMEPLAY</p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\ml1.jpg">
    <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) designed specifically for mobile platforms. The game offers fast-paced matches that typically last between 10 to 15 minutes, making it perfect for players who enjoy quick, yet strategic battles. The main objective is simple: destroy the enemy’s base while defending your own. Controls are intuitive and smooth, featuring a joystick on the left side for movement and skill buttons on the right for attacks and abilities. The game offers various match types including Classic, Ranked, Brawl, Custom, and a rotating selection of Arcade modes to keep things interesting.
      Mobile Legends excels in accessibility, offering a beginner-friendly interface, built-in tutorials, and auto-build options for new players. PvP matchmaking is usually quick, allowing players to jump into matches with minimal wait time. The game also features a well-balanced role system, including Tanks, Fighters, Assassins, Marksmen, Mages, and Supports, allowing for diverse team compositions and strategies. However, the matchmaking system can sometimes feel uneven, especially for solo players, and some heroes can dominate the meta until rebalanced in future patches.

    <p class="game-rev">ITEM</p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\ml2.jpg" >
    <p>Items in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang play a crucial role in shaping a hero's performance throughout a match. Each hero can equip up to six items, which are purchased using gold earned during the game from kills, assists, and farming. The item system is divided into several categories, such as Attack, Magic, Defense, Movement, Jungle, and Roaming, allowing players to customize builds based on their hero's role, the current match situation, and the enemy team's composition. Attack items boost physical damage, critical hits, and lifesteal—perfect for marksmen and assassins. Magic items, on the other hand, provide magic power, cooldown reduction, and mana regeneration, making them ideal for mages and supports. Defensive items offer additional health, armor, magic resistance, and even effects like crowd control reduction or revival after death, which are essential for tanks and frontliners.

      Movement items help enhance mobility with added speed and unique passive effects, while Jungle and Roaming items are specially tailored for players who take on the jungler or roam roles. The game features a built-in recommended build path for each hero, but players can create and save their own custom builds to suit different playstyles or team strategies. One of the strengths of the item system is how it allows for flexibility mid-game—players can adapt their build in real-time to counter specific threats, such as buying anti-heal items against a sustain-heavy team or magic defense against a fed mage. Item passives and actives also add a layer of strategy, as many provide game-changing effects like slowing enemies, granting shields, or dealing bonus damage. Proper itemization can often be the difference between victory and defeat, making in-game decision-making just as important as mechanical skill.

      <p class="game-rev">MAP</p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\ml3.jpg">
    <p>The main battlefield in Mobile Legends is known as the “Land of Dawn,” a traditional 5v5 map featuring three lanes—top, mid, and bottom. Between these lanes lies the jungle, an area filled with neutral creeps, buffs, and objectives like the Turtle and the Lord, which can greatly shift momentum in a match. Defensive structures like turrets and the base core add layers of strategy, requiring teams to push carefully and prioritize key objectives. One important mechanic is the Fog of War, which conceals vision in certain areas and allows for ambushes and ganks. Recent updates to the map have enhanced its appearance with richer textures and added details, while also improving the overall gameplay flow by making jungle rotations and pathing more intuitive.</p>

  <div class="game-entry">
    <p class="game-rev">EVENT</p>
  <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\ml4.jpg">
  <p>One of the strongest features of Mobile Legends is its constantly evolving roster of events. The game frequently hosts limited-time events, seasonal missions, and collaborations with major franchises. Daily login rewards and task-based missions keep players coming back, while Hero Trial events allow users to test out new or premium heroes for free. Special events often feature skin giveaways, lucky draws, and themed quests that offer both cosmetic and gameplay-related rewards. Collaborations have been a big hit, with previous partnerships including globally recognized brands like Star Wars, Transformers, and Attack on Titan. Beyond in-game challenges, the community is also invited to participate in official tournaments such as the MLBB M-Series, as well as local and regional competitive cups. These events help maintain a strong community presence and reward consistent player engagement.
