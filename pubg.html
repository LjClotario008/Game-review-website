  <h1>PLAYER UNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS</h1>
  <div class="game game-entry">
    <p class="game-rev"></p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\pubg1.jpg">
    <p>PUBG Mobile brings the original PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds experience to handheld devices with impressive realism and large-scale survival gameplay. As a battle royale, the core objective is simple: parachute onto a vast map, loot weapons and supplies, and survive against up to 99 other players to become the last person or team standing. The pacing of matches can vary, offering tense, quiet moments as you scout for enemies, followed by sudden, adrenaline-pumping firefights. The game supports both first-person and third-person perspectives, giving players a tactical edge based on personal preference.
        Movement, gunplay, and aiming feel responsive and immersive, especially with customizable controls, gyroscope support, and adjustable sensitivity. Players can choose between solo, duo, or squad modes, and communication is enhanced through voice chat and ping systems. With realistic ballistics, bullet drop, and environmental sound cues, PUBG Mobile appeals to both casual players and hardcore tacticians looking for intense, strategic gameplay. </p>
  <div class="game-entry">
    <p class="game-rev">Weapons and Loadouts</p>
  <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\pubg4.jpg">
  <p>Gun variety is a major part of PUBG Mobile’s depth. From assault rifles like the M416 and AKM to sniper rifles, SMGs, and shotguns, each weapon has its own recoil, damage, and best use case. Players can customize weapons with attachments like scopes, grips, and extended magazines to enhance performance. Tactical gear like grenades, smoke, and molotovs add layers of strategy to both offense and defense. Vehicles such as bikes, jeeps, and boats also play a key role in rotating between zones and securing positioning. </p>
  
  <div class="game-entry">
    <p class="game-rev"> Maps and Game Modes</p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\pubg2.jpg" >
    <p>One of PUBG Mobile’s standout features is its variety of maps, each offering unique terrain, tactics, and gameplay flow. The iconic Erangel map is a balanced mix of forests, towns, and open fields. Miramar brings vast deserts and long-range combat opportunities, while Sanhok offers fast-paced, jungle-style engagements. Vikendi features snowy terrain with reduced visibility and unique sound behavior, and Livik, exclusive to mobile, provides quicker matches with a smaller, fast-paced map design. These maps are rotated frequently and paired with themed updates to keep gameplay fresh.
        Aside from classic battle royale, PUBG Mobile includes limited-time modes and features like Payload, Infection Mode, Metro Royale, Team Deathmatch, and Domination, all found in the Arcade and EvoGround sections. These alternate modes add variety for players who want a break from traditional survival gameplay, letting you test out new strategies or simply enjoy more casual, action-packed fun. </p>

    <div class="game-entry">
      <p class="game-rev">Events and Seasons</p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\pubg3.jpg">
    <p> PUBG Mobile thrives on its seasonal content, battle passes (called the Royale Pass), and ongoing events. Each season introduces new skins, weapon cosmetics, emotes, and sometimes gameplay mechanics or limited-time features tied to themes such as cyberpunk, mythology, or military realism. Special events often feature collaborations with global franchises like Godzilla, Resident Evil, Dragon Ball, and Tesla, adding cinematic flair and unique collectibles to the experience. Weekly missions, login bonuses, and milestone events provide players with regular rewards and goals to work toward.</p>
