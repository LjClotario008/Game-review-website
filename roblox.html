  <h1>ROBLOX</h1>
  <div class="game-entry">
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\r1.jpg">
    <p>Roblox isn’t just a game—it’s a massive online platform where players can explore, create, and play millions of user-generated games across every genre imaginable. Whether you're into action, role-playing, tycoon simulators, obbies (obstacle courses), horror experiences, or hangout spaces, Roblox has something for everyone. Each game is made by players using Roblox Studio, the platform’s game creation tool, giving the community full creative control. Unlike traditional games with fixed gameplay styles, Roblox is more like a hub of limitless gaming experiences built by and for the community.

        The gameplay varies wildly depending on the title you choose. One moment you could be escaping from a haunted mansion in “Doors,” role-playing in “Brookhaven” or “Adopt Me!”, fighting other players in “Arsenal,” or building your own empire in “Bloxburg.” There’s no single objective in Roblox—each experience offers its own set of goals, mechanics, and storylines. The platform is especially popular among younger audiences due to its accessibility, social features, and ease of use. Whether you're casually playing or seriously creating, there's room to express yourself. </p>

   <div class="game-entry">
    <p class="game-rev">  Creation and Scripting</p>
  <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\r2.jpg">
  <p>At the heart of Roblox is Roblox Studio, a game development environment that allows players to create and publish their own games using Lua scripting. This opens up endless possibilities for creators—from simple hobby projects to complex multiplayer games with custom UI, animations, and monetization systems. Many top games on the platform are created by independent developers, some of whom have turned Roblox development into full-time careers. This user-generated content ecosystem is what keeps the platform thriving and constantly evolving.</p>

  <div class="game-entry">
    <p class="game-rev">  Customization and Avatars </p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\r3.jpg" >
    <p>Roblox lets players fully customize their avatars with skins, animations, accessories, emotes, and clothing, many of which are created and sold by other users on the Avatar Shop. Players can also create their own items and earn Robux, the in-game currency, through sales or in-game purchases. Robux can be used to buy cosmetics, unlock premium content in games, or support creators. This system makes Roblox feel like a social network as much as a game—players love showing off their style and joining games with friends.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="game-entry">
      <p class="game-rev"> Events and Community</p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\r4.jpg">
    <p>Roblox is known for its seasonal events, collaborations, and community-driven experiences. Past partnerships include huge crossovers with brands like Nike, Stranger Things, Lil Nas X, Sonic, and Hello Kitty, often introducing themed games or virtual concerts. Roblox also hosts yearly events like the Bloxy Awards and Egg Hunts, where players can collect limited-time items and explore themed games. These events create a sense of community and keep the platform fresh, especially for longtime players.</p>
