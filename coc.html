  <h1>CLASH OF CLANS</h1>
  <div class="game-entry">
    <p class="game-rev"></p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\coc1.jpg">
    <p>Clash of Clans is a long-standing mobile strategy game developed by Supercell that blends base-building, real-time strategy, and asynchronous multiplayer warfare into an addictive and rewarding experience. Players take on the role of a village chief tasked with constructing and upgrading buildings, training troops, managing resources, and defending against enemy attacks. The core gameplay revolves around attacking other players' villages while strengthening your own defenses, with a heavy emphasis on strategic planning and timing.
        The game starts off simple but evolves into a complex strategy battleground. As you progress, you unlock various troops, spells, and siege machines, each with unique abilities. From Giants and Archers to Dragons, Miners, and Electro Titans, troop synergy becomes critical when designing attack strategies for different base layouts. Attacks are real-time but defenses are automated, which means a strong base layout is just as important as offensive skill. Clan Wars, introduced later in the game’s evolution, add a highly competitive element where clans of players go head-to-head in coordinated battles to win loot and bragging rights. </p>

    <p class="game-rev">Base Building and Progression</p>
  <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\coc2.jpg">
  <p>A big part of Clash of Clans' charm lies in base design and resource management. Players collect gold, elixir, and dark elixir to upgrade structures, walls, and troops. Defensive buildings like cannons, archer towers, inferno towers, and x-bows play a vital role in protecting your base from raids. With each Town Hall level, new buildings, troops, and features become available, pushing players to adapt their strategy and layout continuously. Base building is more than just placing structures—successful layouts funnel enemy troops, delay their progress, and protect key resources.</p>

    <p class="game-rev"> Clan Features and Events</p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\coc3.jpg" >
    <p>Clans are at the heart of the community aspect in Clash of Clans. You can join or create a clan to donate troops, chat with members, and participate in Clan Wars, Clan Games, and Clan War Leagues. Clan Games offer a wide variety of fun objectives, encouraging collaboration to earn magical items and rewards. Meanwhile, War Leagues are the competitive battleground for serious clans to climb the ranks and prove their strategic dominance. The game is consistently updated with seasonal events, new challenges, hero skins, and limited-time rewards, keeping long-time players engaged. </p>

    <div class="game-entry">
      <p class="game-rev">Heroes and Special Mechanics</p>
    <img src="c:\Users\Usert\Downloads\coc4.jpg">
    <p>As you level up, you unlock powerful heroes like the Barbarian King, Archer Queen, Grand Warden, and Royal Champion—each with game-changing abilities and upgrade paths. These heroes act as anchors for your army, adding a whole new layer of depth to attack strategies. The Builder Base, a separate game mode, introduces a different style of play with real-time versus battles and different troop mechanics. More recently, Town Hall 15 and newer updates have brought spell towers, monolith defenses, and more complexity to high-level gameplay.</p>
